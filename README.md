# TestVarSPA

TASK 1: Set up project environment and tools
- **Challenges with tool installations**:
  - Resolved issues with 'fnm' not being recognized by reconfiguring the PATH and updating shell initialization scripts.
  - Ensured proper installation of Node.js (LTS), SQLite3, and Git, troubleshooting path issues and verifying functionality.

- **Setting up the project directory**:
  - Created and initialized the 'TestVarSPA' directory with Node.js.
  - Installed essential dependencies: express, sqlite3, body-parser, cors, dotenv, jest, supertest, nodemon, eslint, and prettier.
  - Tools chosen ensure a robust backend (Express, SQLite3), smooth API handling (body-parser, cors), secure environment (dotenv), and reliable testing (jest, supertest). Nodemon, ESLint, and Prettier enhance development efficiency and maintainability.

- **Overcoming Git challenges**:
  - Resolved initial issues with 'git init' and successfully set up version control with all files staged for the first commit.

Project environment and tools are now fully configured.
